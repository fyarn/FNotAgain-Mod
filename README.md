# FNotAgain-Mod

## Description:
This mod saves your pawns when you launch them in a ship, allowing you to crash land with them again! For Rimworld [a17]. With the mod installed, finish a game by selecting your pawns and launching them into space. These pawns will be saved, and if the "Crashlanding?" Mod Setting is checked then these pawns will be automatically selected as your new pawns in your next scenario. All saved pawns will spawn in regardless of scenario starting pawn count limitations.

You can turn off this functionality without disabling/uninstalling the mod in the Mod Settings of the Options page.

## Known Bugs/Limitations/Requirements:
Currently this mod only works for the rocket ship game ending, not the friendly AI caravan ending. Saved pawns will lose their clothes and forget their relationships, and animals won't be saved into the new game even if they are in cryptosleep caskets. 

Must start new game after finishing old game without exiting Rimworld in between (exiting Rimworld clears saved pawns).

Requires Hugslib to be installed, and in the load queue before this mod's place.
